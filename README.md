### Who am I
I am a french CS Student studying at ESIR and now UQAC, interested in computer graphics, rendering, simulation and image processing. I've been programming since I was 13, and I've been learning new tech, software and languages since then. I enjoy games, and organized two gamejams in my school with [Léo-Paul HUAR]([https://github.com/LepGamingGo](https://github.com/GroDoggo)), sponsored by Orange.

### My projects
As of 2023, here are the projects I am most proud of :
- [FFTWater](https://github.com/tlegoc/FFTWater) : WIP Ocean simulation using Fourier transforms, missing the FFT part and using a GPU DFT.
- A XR volumetric video player based on [Kevin Kwok's SplaTV video player](https://github.com/antimatter15/splaTV) using threejs, featuring VR controls for time, support for long videos, and scene descriptions to make the experience more interactive. Done as an internship project at B<>Com.
- [ESIR_ProjetProg](https://github.com/tlegoc/ESIR_ProjetProg) : Game coded for a course in 2 days with 3 friends, with a custom 2D OpenGL game engine made in 5 days by me and @emeraudia. The goal was to see if I could support a team of game devs by adding required features to the engine as quick as possible. By the end of the course, we had a fully functionnal engine with no memory leaks, working collision detection, scene loading, particles and 2D animations.
- [GL_Ants](https://github.com/tlegoc/GL_Ants) : Recreation of an ant simulation in OpenGL. This taught me how to use the API, the concept of compute shaders, and how images and buffers are managed.
- [GodotCPUOptimizedPlane](https://github.com/tlegoc/GodotCPUOptimizedPlane) : Godot 3/4 experiment to see if I could implement some sort of tesselation into Godot, which did not support it at the time. I managed to create a high detail and very large plane, all running at 60fps on a laptop with no dedicated GPU.
- [ShellTexturing](https://github.com/tlegoc/ShellTexturing) : Experimenting with shell texturing and fur, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dr-tRQzij4)
- [wei_app_api_v2](https://github.com/BDE-ISATI/wei-api-v4) : AWS API created for managing challenges and teams for events in my school. It features automatic deployment through SAM.

### Future projects
- 2D (and maybe 3D) Radiance cascade implementation in unity.
- Implementing ghost of tsushima grass rendering technique in unity.
- Experiment more with vulkan to familiarize with the API.
- Implement deferred rendering in vulkan, GPU driven rendering, and/or GPU culling.
- Creating my own basic engine that uses a graph system to allow better customization of the rendering process.
- Teach people on 3D rendering.
