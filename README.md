### Théo Le Goc

### Who am I

Currently working as an engine programmer intern at Asobo, I studied at ESIR for four years and did my last year abroad at UQAC in 2024-2025. I am interested in computer graphics, rendering, simulation and image processing. I've been programming since I was 13, and I've been learning new tech, software and languages since then. I enjoy games, and organized two gamejams in my school with [Léo-Paul HUAR]([https://github.com/LepGamingGo](https://github.com/GroDoggo)), sponsored by Orange.
