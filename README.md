### Théo Le Goc

### 😀 Who am I
I am a french CS Student studying at ESIR, interested in computer graphics, rendering, simulation and image processing. I've been programming since I was 13, and I've been learning new tech, software and languages since then. I enjoy games, and organized a gamejam in my school with @LepGamingGo, sponsored by Orange.

### ⌨️ My projects
As of 2023, here are the projects I am most proud of :
- ESIR_ProjetProg : Game coded for a course in 2 days with 3 friends, with a custom 2D OpenGL game engine made in 5 days by me and @emeraudia. The goal was to see if I could support a team of game devs by adding required features to the engine as quick as possible. By the end of the course, we had a fully functionnal engine with no memory leaks, working collision detection, scene loading, particles and 2D animations.
- GL_Ants : Recreation of an ant simulation in OpenGL. This taught me how to use the API, the concept of compute shaders, and how images and buffers are managed.
- GodotCPUOptimizedPlane : Godot 3/4 experiment to see if I could implement some sort of tesselation into Godot, which did not support it at the time. I managed to create a high detail and very large plane, all running at 60fps on a laptop with no dedicated GPU.
- wei_app_api_v2 : AWS API created for managing challenges and teams for events in my school. It features automatic deployment through SAM.
- vk_engine : Vulkan rendering engine to try and understand the API more. Mostly made following a tutorial, although I implemented dynamic rendering myself.
- gl_pbr_engine : OpenGL deferred rendering engine, with passes management, #include processor in shaders, image and model loading. Not finished yet, but I plan to implement PBR.

### ❓ Future projects
- Implementing ghost of tsushima grass rendering technique in unity.
- Experiment more with vulkan to familiarize with the API.
- Implement deferred rendering in vulkan, GPU driven rendering, and/or GPU culling.
- Create my own highly customizable game/rendering engine for my own games, featuring scripting through another language, map loading, deffered rendering.
- Teach people on 3D rendering.
